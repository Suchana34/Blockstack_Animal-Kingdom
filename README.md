# Animal Kingdom Sample app

This sample app allows a user to create their own animal kingdom. They create their own
animal persona and then populate their kingdom with rulers or subjects of other kingdoms
either on the same app or on other forks of this app.

To add an animal to your kingdom, you can enter the animal's URL into the box.

Each app can have different animals and territories. Animals and territories that only exist
in one instance of this app (a "planet") can be used in other instances.

You can browse kingdoms on other instances and forks of this apps from the other kingdom section.

## How this works

Information about each animal and the subjects in a kingdom is loaded from
the creating user's Gaia storage. Images of the animal persona and territories
are loaded from the instance of the app where they were created.
